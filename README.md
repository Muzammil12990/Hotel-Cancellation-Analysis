# Hotel Cancellation Analysis

# Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations to identify patterns and insights. By exploring key factors influencing cancellations, we can derive actionable insights for improving booking strategies and customer retention.

# Dataset
The dataset includes details about hotel reservations, such as:
- Booking details (hotel type, reservation dates, lead time, etc.)
- Customer demographics (country, market segment, etc.)
- Room and pricing details
- Cancellation status

# Objectives
- Understand the factors affecting hotel cancellations
- Identify trends in booking behaviors
- Develop predictive insights for hotel management

# Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization (graphs and plots to illustrate trends)

# Key Insights
- Impact of booking lead time on cancellations
- Effect of price fluctuations on cancellation rates
- Seasonal variations in booking behavior
- Market segments with high cancellation rates

# How to Use
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (Hotel--cancellation--Analysis.ipynb).
- Run the notebook cells in sequence to process and visualize the data.
- Modify the dataset or analysis steps as needed for deeper insights.

# Future Work
- Implement machine learning models for cancellation prediction.
- Expand analysis to include customer reviews and sentiment analysis.
- Develop a dashboard for real-time booking insights
